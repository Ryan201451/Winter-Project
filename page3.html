<p>Hiya, Barbie
    Hi, Ken
    You want to go for a ride?
    Sure, Ken
    Jump in
    I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
    Life in plastic, it's fantastic
    You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
    Imagination, life is your creation
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party
    I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
    Life in plastic, it's fantastic
    You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
    Imagination, life is your creation
    I'm a blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world
    Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly
    You're my doll, rock'n'roll, feel the glamour in pink
    Kiss me here, touch me there, hanky panky
    You can touch
    You can play
    If you say, "I'm always yours" (ooh, oh)
    I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
    Life in plastic, it's fantastic
    You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
    Imagination, life is your creation
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
    Make me walk, make me talk, do whatever you please
    I can act like a star, I can beg on my knees
    Come jump in, bimbo friend, let us do it again
    Hit the town, fool around, let's go party
    You can touch
    You can play
    If you say, "I'm always yours"
    You can touch
    You can play
    If you say, "I'm always yours"
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
    I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
    Life in plastic, it's fantastic
    You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
    Imagination, life is your creation
    I'm a Barbie girl, in the Barbie world
    Life in plastic, it's fantastic
    You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
    Imagination, life is your creation
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ah ah ah yeah)
    Come on, Barbie, let's go party (ooh oh, ooh oh)
    Oh, I'm having so much fun
    Well, Barbie, we're just getting started
    Oh, I love you, Ken</p>
