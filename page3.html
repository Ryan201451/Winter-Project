<p>Jingle bells
    Jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun
    It is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh
    (Repeat)
    Dashing through the snow
    In a one-horse open sleigh
    O'er the fields we go
    Laughing all the way
    Ha ha ha
    Bells on bobtail ring
    Making spirits bright
    What fun it is to ride and sing
    A sleighing song tonight
    Jingle bells
    Jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun
    It is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh
    (Repeat)
    Now the ground is white
    And the night is young
    Take the sleigh tonight
    And join us in this song
    Just get a bob tailed bay
    Get ready for a run
    Then hitch him to a sleigh
    And now we'll have some fun!‚Äù
    Jingle bells
    Jingle bells
    Jingle all the way
    Oh, what fun
    It is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh</p>
